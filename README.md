# Date With Offset

In JavaScript, all `Date`s have a local time zone. On my computer:

```javascript
var now = new Date();
// Sun Apr 14 2013 09:49:16 GMT-0700 (PDT)
```

This makes working with time zones difficult. You can represent that date in
UTC with `Date.prototype.toISOString`:

```javascript
now.toISOString();
// "2013-04-14T16:49:16.576Z"
```

Unfortunately, you can't pass around an actual `Date` in any other time zone.
Instead, create a `DateWithOffset`:

```javascript
var nowInUTC = new DateWithOffset(0);
// Sun Apr 14 2013 16:49:16 GMT+0000
```

## Creating `DateWithOffset`s

The `DateWithOffset` constructor works just like the `Date` constructor, but
the *last* argument is always the offset from UTC in minutes. Some examples:

```javascript
var nowInParis = new DateWithOffset(60);
// Sun Apr 14 2013 17:49:16 GMT+0100

var theSameTimeInMelbourne = new DateWithOffset(nowInParis, 600);
// Mon Apr 15 2013 02:49:16 GMT+1000
```

### Date Parsing

If the first argument is a String and contains an offset end with "Z",
it is treated as UTC time:

```
var newYearsGMTInBoston = new DateWithOffset("Jan 1 2013 00:00Z", -300);
// Mon Dec 31 2012 19:00:00 GMT-0500
```

If it's a String and doesn't contain an offset of end with "Z", it is treated
as local to the given offset:

```
var newYearsInBoston = new DateWithOffset("Jan 1 2013 00:00", -300);
// Tue Jan 01 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500
```

Similarly, `DateWithOffset`s created with individual year, month, and day
(and, optionally, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) arguments are
treated as local to the given offset:

```
var newYearsInChicago = new DateWithOffset(2013, 0, 1, -360);
```

**Note** this behavior differs from that of the normal `Date` constructor,
which treats such strings as local to the *browser* (or server execution
environment).

### Daylight Savings Time

Many time zones obey Daylight Savings. This means that they can't be
repesented as a single number; rather, they are a `function` that returns
a different offset based on the `Date` passed in.

Imagine a mythical time zone that is three hours ahead (East) of GMT from
November through March each year, and four hours ahead April through October.
If you represent this time zone with the following function:

```javascript
function mythicalTimeZone(date) {
  var month = date.getMonth();
  return (month < 3 || month > 9) ? 180 : 240;
}
```

you could create dates in this time zone as follows:

```javascript
var date = new DateWithOffset(2013, 5, 16, mythicalTimeZone); // June 16 2013, MDT
date.getTimezoneOffset(); // -240
```

If you *modify* the date, it will use the correct offset for the new time:

```javascript
date.setMonth(1); // February 16, 2013, MST
date.getTimezoneOFfset(); // -180
```

### Rich Offset Objects

The last argument can be a `Number` or `function` (as above) or anything that
responds to `valueOf`. If you have richer time zone objects, you can pass them
directly into `new DateWithOffset`:

```javascript
var tokyo = {
  name: 'Tokyo',
  toString: function() { return 'Tokyo (GMT+0900)' },
  valueOf: function() { return 540; }
};

var nowInTokyo = new DateWithOffset(now, tokyo);
// Mon Apr 15 2013 01:49:16 GMT+0900
```

***Note***: the offset is that between *this* object and *UTC*, which means
that it is positive if the object's time zone is ahead of UTC and negative
if it is behind. This is the opposite of what
[`Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTimezoneOffset)
returns.

## Compatibility with `Date`

You can use a `DateWithOffset` anywhere you use a `Date`:

```javascript
nowInUTC.getHours();                  // 16
nowInParis.getTime();                 // 1365958156000
theSameTimeInMelbourne.getTime();     // 1365958156000
newYearsInBoston.getTimezoneOffset(); // 300

newYearsInBoston.setDate(15);
newYearsInBoston;                     // Tue Jan 15 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500
```

## Additional Features

Get back the original offset:

```
nowInBoston.offset();
// -300

nowInTokyo.offset().toString();
// "Tokyo (GMT+0900)"
```

Get a new `DateWithOffset` representing the same point in time at a
different UTC offset:

```
var nowInChicago = nowInBoston.withOffset(-300)
```

Get a plain `Date` representing the same point in time at the local offset:

```
var nowInLocal = nowInParis.date();
```

[node-time](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-time) provides very similar
functionality with a different API. It supports time zone names (not just
offsets), but only runs in Node.
